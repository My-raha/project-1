      Imagine knowing what the brain craves from every tale it encounters, what
      fuels the success of any great story, and what keeps readers transfixed.
      Wired for Story reveals these cognitive secrets--and it's a game-changer
      for anyone who has ever set pen to paper. The vast majority of writing
      advice focuses on "writing well" as if it were the same as telling a great
      story. This is exactly where many aspiring writers fail--they strive for
      beautiful metaphors, authentic dialogue, and interesting characters,
      losing sight of the one thing that every engaging story must do: ignite
      the brain's hardwired desire to learn what happens next. When writers tap
      into the evolutionary purpose of story and electrify our curiosity, it
      triggers a delicious dopamine rush that tells us to pay attention. Without
      it, even the most perfect prose won't hold anyone's interest. Backed by
      recent breakthroughs in neuroscience as well as examples from novels,
      screenplays, and short stories, Wired for Story offers a revolutionary
      look at story as the brain experiences it. Each chapter zeroes in on an
      aspect of the brain, its corresponding revelation about story, and the way
      to apply it to your storytelling right now.
